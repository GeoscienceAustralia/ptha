# Frictionless flow oscillations in a 1D parabolic canal, including wetting and drying and a Coriolis term

We simulate flow in a 1D canal with parabolic geometry using the nonlinear shallow water equations. An analytical solution to this problem is known in the case of frictionless flow with a Coriolis term, and is reviewed in [Sampson et al. (2006), ANZIAM J. 47 (EMAC2005) pp.C373â€“C387](https://journal.austms.org.au/V47EMAC2005/Sampson/Sampson.pdf).

The analytical solution to this problem is formulated in Cartesian coordinates, assuming a constant Coriolis forcing. Because SWALS only includes a Coriolis term in spherical coordinate models, we simulate the test problem in spherical coordinates, using a 10km long (east-west), 500m wide (north-south) domain located at 30 degrees north. Over this north-south extent, variations in Coriolis are small. A periodic north-south boundary condition is employed to emulate a Cartesian domain. This is clearly non-physical, but is adequate for modelling this problem.
