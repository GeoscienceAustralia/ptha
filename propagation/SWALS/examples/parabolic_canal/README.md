# Frictionless flow oscillations in a parabolic canal, including wetting and drying and a Coriolis term

We simulate flow in a canal with parabolic geometry using the nonlinear shallow water equations. An analytical solution to this problem is known in the case of frictionless flow with a Coriolis term, and is reviewed in [Sampson et al. (2006), ANZIAM J. 47 (EMAC2005) pp.C373â€“C387](https://journal.austms.org.au/V47EMAC2005/Sampson/Sampson.pdf). The solution features periodic oscillations of the free surface and the U and V velocities (the amplitude of the latter scales with the Coriolis force).

The analytical solution to this problem is formulated in Cartesian coordinates, assuming a constant Coriolis forcing, whereas SWALS only includes a Coriolis term in Spherical coordinate solvers. Therefore the [SWALS model](parabolic_canal.f90) uses spherical coordinates with a 10km long parabolic canal (east-west oriented) which is 500m wide (north-south oriented) and located at 30 degrees north. Over this small north-south extent, variations in Coriolis are small. A periodic north-south boundary condition is employed to emulate the Cartesian domain (which for the analytical problem, has infinite extent in the NS direction). This periodic boundary is clearly non-physical, but is adequate for modelling this problem because the domain width is small (so changes in spherical coordinate metric terms have only a minor impact).
