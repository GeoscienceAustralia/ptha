# NTHMP tsunami currents benchmark problem 1: Eddy shedding around a conical island.

We simulate an experiement in which a steady flow is input to a mostly flat-bedded flume, which contains a submerged rise or island (with the shape of a truncated cone). As the flow passes the submerged island, turbulent eddies develop. These are evident in the velocities measured at two sites in the experiment.

The problem is described in the [NTHMP tsunami velocities benchmark suite](http://coastal.usc.edu/currents_workshop/problems/prob1.html).


We have to run the model for long enough to reach a (statistically) steady state.

From slides associated with the NTHMP currents workshop, we can see that models often find it difficult to get this right. Also the problem is quite sensitive to friction.
