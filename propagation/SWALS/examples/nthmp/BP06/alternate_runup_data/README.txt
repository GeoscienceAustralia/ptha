The runup around the conical island experiment is reported by Briggs et al.
(1995), although not all details are included. The results of this experiment
are reported in various other papers, but there is some inconsistency in the
island runup values.
- The Briggs et al. (1995) runup results are reported by Liu et al (1995) in
  terms of "R/A" where R is runup (cm), and A is a target wave amplitude (0.016
  m for Case A, 0.032 m for Case B, 0.064 m for Case C). The same results
  are reported in tabular form in Ma et al. (2019), and Choi et al. (2007)
    - These 3 studies each compare these observations with models (2d or 3d)
      -- and their models agree with the data fairly well. 
- The Briggs et al. (1995) runup results are also reported in the NTHMP test
  repository {https://github.com/rjleveque/tsunami_benchmarks}, and graphically
  in Synolakis et al (2008) and the NTHMP report
    - But the reported runup turns out to be quite different, especially for Case A. For instance,
      the maximal case A runup is about 1cm lower all around the island, as compared
      with the Liu/Choi/Ma version of the data -- a difference of 1/3rd
    - Confusingly, for this version of the data we also see reasonably good
      model-vs-data comparisons reported in the literature (e.g. NTHMP
      reports)!

When I convergence test various shallow water models, I seem to get results
closer to the Liu/Choi/Ma version or the data for case A (e.g. see the SWALS and Funwave
results).
