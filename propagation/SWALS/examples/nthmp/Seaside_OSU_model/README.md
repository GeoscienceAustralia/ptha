# NTHMP tsunami currents benchmark problem 5: Seaside OSU experiment of tsunami inundation through a city

We model the Seaside OSU experiment from Park et al. (2013), which simulates tsunami inundation through a city. A movie of this problem is [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj98sHcTGOo).

Data for this problem was obtained from the [NTHMP velocities benchmark suite](http://coastal.usc.edu/currents_workshop/problems.html). That page also links to presentations from other modelling groups, and can help give an idea of the performance we might expect. See also the NTHMP currents workshop report (NTHMP, 2017).

Figures 1 and 2 below show the [SWALS model](model.f90) structure, elevation data and locations of gauges. The model uses two nested domains with 4x grid refinement near the city. A wave time-series is applied from the west. Gauges WG3, WG4 are used to check that the boundary forcing is reasonable. To the east is a "city" that includes 4 rows of gauges (A1-9, B1-9, C1-9, D1-4), where the model is compared with data on depths, cross-shore velocities, and cross-shore momentum fluxes ($u^2h$). Here "cross-shore" is taken to be the x-direction as specified in the NTHMP problem description.

The model is forced using a provided synthetic stage time-series at x=5m, which bypasses the need for a wavemaker forcing around x=0m. The boundary speeds are specified with the plane wave relation ($uh = \sqrt{g h} stage$). Both are provided to a Flather boundary condition which tries to enforce the wave while eliminating spurious reflections. Figure 3 compares the modelled and prescribed boundary stage, along with a gauge observation at x=2m (outside our domain, but inside the experimental domain). The model does a reasonable job of representing the boundary forcing, and increases the stage at later times (consistent with the observed gauge) to reduce boundary reflections.

Figure 4 compares the model and observations at gauges WG3 and WG4. They are in general agreement. For this problem we do not expect perfect agreement as the flow is physically affected by non-hydrostatic physics, which is not represented with the nonlinear shallow water equations.

# Model performance at the urban gauges

Below we compare the modeled and observed depths, cross-shore speeds, and cross-shore momentum fluxes. The model is in general agreement with the data. There are a few cases where the model does less well (e.g. the momentum fluxes for gauges B1 and C1). Here the literature suggests that a non-hydrostatic model may be required to better match the results.

## Issues

- The proper treatment of the landward boundary in this problem is unclear. Park et al. (2013) develop a numerical model of their experiment, and note that its landward boundary differs from the physical model, such that reflected waves arrive earlier in the model than in the experiment. We also see this in the model of Macias et al (2020) which is setup based on the description here (see gauge B9 in their paper). Herein we prevent wave reflection from the landward boundary by adding an artificial trough that catches the water, but suggest the correct treatment is unclear.
- Many modellers report under-prediction of depth maxima at gauge 'B1' (Macias et al. 2020; NTHMP 2017), and also 'A1 and C1' (Gao et al., 2020), relatively good results at gauges B4, B6, and varying results at B9 (e.g. over-estimation in Park et al; underestimation in Macais et al (2020)). In our plotting script I have added approximate "PASS/FAIL" critera based on the observed performance, and while useful for detecting future regressions in the model performance, the critera do not have strong justication.
- This benchmark problem can be forced using either a wave-maker forcing, or a provided model time-series. We do the latter, although it leads to some phase-offset at gauges WG3 and WG4, as noted previously by Macias et al (2020). The latter authors suggest this is probably due to a mistake in the provided initial condition. In future it would be good to try a wavemaker forcing.
- The velocity and flux data are in the "cross-shore" direction. The problem indicates this is the x direction, which we use here, although it might instead be the along-street direction which is slightly different?
