## 1D "Landslide" runup on uniformly sloping beach

This test case is `Benchmark Problem 1` from the `Third International workshop on long-wave runup models, June 17-18 2004`. 

It simulates the runup of an initial waveform on a linearly sloping beach. The analytical solution was produced
using the techniques of Carrier, Wu and Yeh (2003). 

The problem descriptions and solution were sourced from [http://isec.nacse.org/workshop/2004_cornell/bmark1.html](http://isec.nacse.org/workshop/2004_cornell/bmark1.html).
