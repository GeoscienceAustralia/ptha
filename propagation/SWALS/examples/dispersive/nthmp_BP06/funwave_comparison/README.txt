The subfolders contain input files required to run funwave for Case A, Case B, Case C. Running the models also requires unzipping the zip file [from the nondispersive funwave runs](../../../nthmp/BP06/funwave_comparison/) in the current directory.

These input files were modified from non-dispersive inputs in directory linked above. See there for further documentation.
