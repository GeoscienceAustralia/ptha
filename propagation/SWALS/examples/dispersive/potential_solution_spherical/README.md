# Radially symmetric potential flow in spherical coordinates: analytical solution vs dispersive solver

This problem is just like [../potential_solution](../potential_solution) but
uses spherical coordinates with a domain centred at 45 degrees north. The
domain is very small, so a local Cartesian approximation is accurate. 

This provides an opportunity to check the dispersive solver in spherical
coordinates.
