# Code to define commands to execute test programs

# This gives a central place to define e.g. number of openmp threads, or method
# to invoke mpi. Makes it easier to test efficiently on different machines.

# FIXME: Currently some of the validation tests ASSUME 6 mpi processes (or
# coarray images). This includes the tests with a prescribed
# load_balance_partition file. In future the tests might be adapted to generate
# those files from the information below. For now keep 6 mpi processes, but
# optionally change the number of openmp threads
