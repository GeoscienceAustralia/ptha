# ptha
Codes for probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment. 

The main codes and README information reside in the folder [R](R). This
includes the R package [rptha](R/rptha), and various tutorials and template
scripts (including project-specific scripts used for the 2018 Australian PTHA).

The folder [propagation](propagation) contains a shallow water equations solver.

The folder [ptha_access](ptha_access) contains scripts/tutorials to access the
2018 Australian PTHA results - typically subsets thereof, since the full
analysis is several TB in size.

The folder [misc](misc) contains data and code for related work, as detailed therein.

*Please use the most up-to-date source code, not the "releases".  In this
repository, "releases" are only used to snapshot the code at some point in time
(e.g. a reference for older studies). The master branch is recommended for general
use, and should pass the full test suite.*
