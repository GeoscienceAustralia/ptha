# Desired spacing of sub-unit-source points
# Lower values (e.g. 1000) may be required for accuracy in unit sources
# near the trench, because shallow deformation tends to be quite localised.
# For deeper unit sources, a much coarser point spacing can be used without
# sacrificing accuracy. 
# Hence we use different values for the 'shallow' sub-unit-source points (i.e.
# < 50km down dip) and the deeper ones.
# The computational effort approximately scales with the inverse square of
# the point density.

# Taper edges of unit_source slip with circular filter having this radius (m)
# This can be useful to avoid features of the Okada solution associated with
# slip discontinuities at the rupture edges. 
# E.G. For ruptures with shallow (but non-zero) top depth, the Okada solution
# suggests a high 'ridge' of deformation just above the top-edge, which is
# entirely due to the discontinuity in the slip. Slip tapering will smooth out
# such features.
slip_edge_taper_width = 10000

# For computational efficiency, only compute the okada deformation at
# distances <= okada_distance_factor x (depth of sub-unit-source point) 
# This can save computational effort for shallow unit sources.
# But be careful if using a wide subunitsource_point_spacing.
okada_distance_factor = 20 # Inf 

# Spatial scale for sub-cell point integration
# During the Okada computation, points with "abs(deformation) > 10% of max(abs(deformation))"
# will have deformations re-computed as the average of the 16 Okada point values
# around point p. These 16 points have coordinates:
#     points = expand.grid(p[1] + cell_integration_scale[1]*c(-1,-1/3,1/3,1), 
#                          p[2] + cell_integration_scale[2]*c(-1,-1/3,1/3,1))
# If 'cell_integration_scale' is close to half the grid size, then this is an approximation
# of the within-pixel average Okada deformation. We do this because near the trench,
# the Okada deformation might not be smooth [e.g. when rupture depth --> 0], and this
# reduces the chance of artificial 'spikes' in the Okada deformation.
# In the code below, this is only applied along the 'top' row of unit-sources
# where the trench depth might --> 0.
