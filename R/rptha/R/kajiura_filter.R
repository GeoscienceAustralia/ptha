#' Compute Kajiura's filter function

#' The function value is the sum over n in [0, Infty] of

#' For a more efficient and vectorized implementation, see kajiura_g_empirical
#' which approximates this function using splines and a log transform.
#'
#' @param r numeric. Value of r in the equation
#' @param nt Integer. Number of terms. We compare the sum of the first nt terms, and the

#' Get a function to efficiently evaluate Kajiura's G function
#'
#' This function returns a function which can be used to efficiently
#' evaluate Kajiura's G function. It is computed by tabulating the function
#' at 'n' points between r = 0 and r=rMax, and then fitting a spline to the
#' log-transformed result. The latter spline is used to lookup log(kajiura_g), 
#' and the exponential transform is applied to correct the result. Our tests
#' suggest the approach is highly accurate, and in R it is much more efficient than
#' direct computation.
#'
#' @param rMax maximum value of r at which lookup is desired
#' @param n number of points used to empirically approximate the log-function
#' values.
#' @return Function to compute kajiura_G from an input vector of R values <= rMax.

#' Implementation of a Kajiura filter 
#'
#' Implement the filter similar to that of Glimsdal et al (2013, Eqns 10-11), based on Kajiura (1963). \cr
#' \deqn{ newDeformation(x,y) = depth(x,y)^{-2} \int \int \big{[}oldDeformation(x',y')G( \sqrt{(x'-x)^2+(y'-y)^2} / depth(x, y) )\big{]} dx' dy'}
#' This is a 2D generalisation of the cosh filter, justified for a 'temporally short'
#' earthquake with ocean governed by linear wave equations in constant depth
#' water. The definition of G is explained further in the help for \code{kajiura_g}\cr
#' Essentially: \cr
#' xyDef[,3] <-- convolution of the "old deformation" and "a smoothing kernel which integrates to 1"\cr
#' Numerically, we compute the new deformation as: \cr
#' \deqn{ numerator_{nm} = sum_{i} sum_{j} oldDeformation_{ij} * G( \sqrt{ (x_{nm} - x_{ij})^2 + (y_{nm} - y_{ij})^2} / depth_{nm} ) }
#' \deqn{ denominator_{nm} = sum_{i} sum_{j} G( \sqrt{ (x_{nm} - x_{ij})^2 + (y_{nm} - y_{ij})^2} / depth_{nm} ) }
#' \deqn{ newDeformation_{nm} = numerator_{nm} / denominator_{nm} }
#' where nm and ij denote pixel coordinates on a regular (cartesian) grid. So at any point
#' nm, the new deformation is a weighted average of nearby values, with weights
#' coming from Kajiuras function.\cr
#' This is slightly different to the approach used in Glimsdal et al (2013), but is
#' equivalent for constant depth. With non-constant depth the underlying theory is
#' not exactly valid, but should provide a reasonable approximation for slowly varying depths.\cr
#' We attempt to reduce edge effects by linearly weighting original and filtered values at edges,
#' since we cannot efficiently deal with edge effects in a better way. Therefore
#' it is best to have unimportant features around the edge of the input points. \cr
#' We allow xyDef to be unstructured, and start by gridding the results
#' on a grid with spacing approximately grid_dx,grid_dy.
#' The grid spacing is not exactly grid_dx,grid_dy, because it is forced to 
#' exactly divide the maximum input depth. \cr
#' For deformations with discontinuities, there can be artefacts due to
#' regridding, and it may be numerically beneficial to rotate the x,y input
#' coordinates so that the discontinuity is aligned with one of the coordinate
#' axes. (This is done in make_tsunami_unit_source).
#' 
#' @param xyDef  3 column matrix with x,y, deformation. x and y can be unstructured.
#' The x,y coordinate system must be cartesian and in m
#' @param depth vector with the depth at each x,y point in xyDef (in m)
#' @param grid_dx Numeric (m). See grid_dy
#' @param grid_dy Numeric (m). To apply the filter, we regrid xyDef on a grid with
#' point spacing grid_dx, grid_dy, then smooth, then transform back from the grid
#' to our original xy points. This should ideally be a fraction of the depth in
#' areas of significant deformation.
#' @param edge_buffer_value Numeric. Outside the domain edges we assume this is
#' the value of xyDef[,3], when the filter is applied. Without further correction, this
#' would make edges tend towards edge_buffer_value
#' @param edge_effect_correction_scale To reduce edge effects, after
#' filtering, we compute the distance of every point to the edge of the domain
#' 'd', and then return the solution \cr
#' WT = max( 1-d/(reference_depth*edge_effect_correction_scale), 0)**0.5 \cr
#' OUTPUT = WT*(ORIGINAL OUTPUT) + (1-WT)*FILTERED OUTPUT \cr
#' @param interpolator 'linear' or 'nearest'. Linear is better, but may be slow for
#' large point clouds. Don't use nearest unless grid_x, grid_y are 'small enough'
#' @param interpolator_categories Function of xy (matrix of coordinates)
#' returning a value for each point, with distinct values corresponding to
#' distinct 'groups' of points. Interpolation will be performed separately on
#' each group. It is passed as \code{category_function} to \code{interpolation_discontinuous}
#' @param kajiuraGmax When empirically approximating kajiuraG, we fit it from
#' x=[0, kajiuraGmax]. Values above this are evaluated to zero. Be cautious about changing this.
#' @param volume_change_error_threshold If the difference in the positive or
#' negative or total volume before and after filtering, relative to the original
#' 'absolute' volume, is more than this, then throw an error. This might not indicate a mistake,
#' but it does indicate a large change in the deformation, which is worth investigating.
#' Possible causes include strong depth variation, or regridding with coarse grid_dx, grid_dy.
#' @param volume_change_MSL The mean-sea-level used to define positive/negative deformation
#' for the volume check mentioned above.
#' @param verbose Print lots of information about the fit
#' @param fortran_inner_loop Use compiled fortran for the inner loop instead of R
#' @return replacement version of xyDef, with smoothing applied to xyDef[,3]
