\title{Given Mw, compute parameters which characterise the 'probability
distribution' of slip, supposing area varies as a log-normal distribution
according to the Strasser (2010) scaling relation.}
\usage{
compute_slip_density_parameters(
  Mw,
  mu = 3e+10,
  constant = 9.05,
  relation = "Strasser"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Mw}{the moment magnitude}

\item{mu}{Shear Modulus (Pascals)}

\item{constant}{Value of constant passed to \code{M0_2_Mw}}

\item{relation}{scaling relation type, passed to \code{Mw_2_rupture_size}}
}
\value{
A list containing 1) The log10(Slip) mean and stanard deviation and
2) The associated mean slip (mean of the untransformed slip)
}
\description{
FIXME: This function is not currently exported -- do we want to keep it?
Seems a good idea. \cr
We assume mu is constant, and log10(Area) has a normal distribution. Since
the seismic moment = mu*slip*Area, this implies that log10(Slip) has a normal
distribution as well. So the mean and standard deviation of the log10
variable completely describe it. As well as returning those values, we return
the mean slip (mean of untransformed slip) since its calculation is slightly
inconvenient.
