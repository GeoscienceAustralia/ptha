\title{Compute ground surface displacements in linear elastic half-space from known
subfault ruptures, using Okada's (1985) solution for rectangular subfaults.}
\usage{
okada_tsunami(
  elon,
  elat,
  edep,
  strk,
  dip,
  lnth,
  wdt,
  disl1,
  disl2,
  rlon,
  rlat,
  dstmx = 9e+20,
  dstmx_min = 20,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{elon}{-- numeric vector with x rupture centroid location (m)}

\item{elat}{-- numeric vector with y of rupture centroid location (m)}

\item{edep}{-- numeric vector with centroid depth of rupture (km)}

\item{strk}{-- numeric vector with strike of sub-fault (degrees clockwise from North)}

\item{dip}{-- numeric vector with dip of rupture (degrees below the horizontal, dipping to the right when looking in the along-strike direction)}

\item{lnth}{-- numeric vector with length of sub-fault (km)}

\item{wdt}{-- numeric vector with width of sub-fault (km)}

\item{disl1}{-- numeric vector with along-strike disloacation on the sub-fault (m)}

\item{disl2}{-- numeric vector with up-dip disloacation on the sub-fault (m)}

\item{rlon}{-- numeric vector with x locations where output is desired (m)}

\item{rlat}{-- numeric vector with y locations where output is desired (m)}

\item{dstmx}{-- optional maximum distance at which sub-faults can cause
displacement (as a multiple of the depth). This can save computing time.}

\item{dstmx_min}{-- minimum value of dstmx*depth passed to the okada routine. Serves as a lower
bound on the distance over which Okada computations occur, relevant for very shallow rupture.}

\item{verbose}{-- TRUE/FALSE -- print info on ground deformation}
}
\value{
-- list with edsp, ndsp, zdsp giving the displacements in the
east,north, and vertical directions. Often we are only interested in the
latter.
}
\description{
Complex ruptures can be treated using multiple sub-faults. We assume lambda = mu
(so Poisson's ratio = 0.25).

# Simple example -- pure thrust fault
