The code
[get_scenarios_similar_to_historical_events.R](get_scenarios_similar_to_historical_events.R)
shows how to download and plot the initial conditions for PTHA18 scenarios that
had top-3 goodness of fit when compared with historical data at DART buoys.

There is no guarentee that these scenarios will match the tsunami as observed
elsewhere -- sometimes they will, but not always. In principle one should
expect to get better accuracy using an inverted source that considers data
at your specific site of interest.
