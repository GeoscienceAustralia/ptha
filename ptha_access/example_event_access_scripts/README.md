# Examples of scenario data extraction

The scripts in this directory give a few examples of extracting a tsunami
scenarios from the PTHA database.

## Plot tsunami deformation and gauge time-series for a number of events

The code in [gauge_and_deformation_plots](gauge_and_deformation_plots) can be
useful to eyeball many scenarios, to assist with manual event selection.

## Extract a few time-series at some target points, with prescribed maximum-stage values or exceedance-rates, using an ad-hoc approach to get just a few scenarios

See [extract_a_few_events_adhoc_approach](extract_a_few_events_adhoc_approach)

## Initial conditions for scenarios that are similar to historic tsunamis

See [./scenarios_similar_to_historical/](./scenarios_similar_to_historical/)

## Random sampling of scenarios

See [./random_scenario_sampling](./random_scenario_sampling)
