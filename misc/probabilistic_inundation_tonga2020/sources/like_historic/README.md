This folder contained the following tif initial conditions. Here we do not include the files directly to keep the file-size down, but instead explain how to obtain the files. 

* `Williamson_chile_sources_SUM_KAJIURA_SMOOTHED.tif` - This was used to represent the 2015 Chile earthquake-tsunami initial condition. It is one of the sources from [this folder](../../../nearshore_testing_2020/sources), see the README there for an explanation on obtaining it.

* `kermadectonga2_26849_variable_uniform_gauge_summary_stats_session_kermadectonga2_tonga_2006_05_03_Mw8.0.Rdata.tif`. This is one of the relatively good-fitting variable-area-uniform-slip scenarios from PTHA18 for the Tonga 2006 event. It can be obtained by generating the good-fitting VAUS scenarios [as explained here](../../../../ptha_access/example_event_access_scripts/scenarios_similar_to_historical/).

* `kurilsjapan_46994_stochastic_gauge_summary_stats_session_kurilsjapan_tohoku_2011_03_11_Mw9.1.Rdata.tif`. This is one of the relatively good heterogeneous-slip scenarios from PTHA18 for the Tohoku 2011 event. It can be obtained by generating the HS good-fitting scenarios [as explained here](../../../../ptha_access/example_event_access_scripts/scenarios_similar_to_historical/).

* `southamerica_128607_stochastic_gauge_summary_stats_session_southamerica_chile_2010_02_27_Mw8.8.Rdata.tif`. This is one of the relatively good heterogeneous-slip scenarios from PTHA18 for the Chile 2010 event. It can be obtained by generating the good-fitting HS scenarios [as explained here](../../../../ptha_access/example_event_access_scripts/scenarios_similar_to_historical/).
