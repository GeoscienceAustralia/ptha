This folder contains elevation data used in the tsunami model. As the full set of files is large, it is provided as a bzip2 compressed tar archive for separate download here: INSERT LINK

When the latter folder is extracted, the current directory should contain subfolders and a README, like:
```
derived_for_model  derived_for_model_NWWA_update  derived_for_model_SWWA_update  orig   README.md
```
