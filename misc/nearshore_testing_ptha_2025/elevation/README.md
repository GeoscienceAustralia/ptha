This folder contains elevation data used in the tsunami model. As the full set of files is large, it is provided as a [15 Gb bzip2 compressed tar archive for separate download here](https://thredds.nci.org.au/thredds/fileServer/fj6/PTHA/Nearshore_testing_2025/elevation.tar.bz2).

When the latter folder is extracted (e.g. using `bzip2 -d ...` or `bunzip2 ...`), the current directory should contain subfolders and a README, like:
```
derived_for_model  derived_for_model_NWWA_update  derived_for_model_SWWA_update  orig   README.md
```
