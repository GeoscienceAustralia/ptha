This code was run on the NCI. While it hasn't been run outside that environment, the datasets should be available if you replace paths starting with `/g/data/fj6/PTHA/AustPTHA_1/SOURCE_ZONES/` with the equivalent path on the THREDDS server, i.e. `https://thredds.nci.org.au/thredds/dodsC/fj6/PTHA/AustPTHA_1/SOURCE_ZONES/`
