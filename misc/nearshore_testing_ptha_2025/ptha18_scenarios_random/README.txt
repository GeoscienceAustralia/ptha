This folder should contain the random scenarios and code used to create them.

However only the code is provided here because the resulting files are large. Thus they are available for download separately at: https://thredds.nci.org.au/thredds/fileServer/fj6/PTHA/Nearshore_testing_2025/ptha18_scenarios_random.tar.bz2
