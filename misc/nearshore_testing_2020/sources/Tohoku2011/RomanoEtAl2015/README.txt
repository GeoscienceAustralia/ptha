This source was created with finite-element-derived unit-sources for the paper:

Romano, F.; Trasatti, E.; Lorito, S.; Piromallo, C.; Piatanesi, A.; Ito, Y.; Zhao, D.; Hirata, K.; Lanucara, P. & Cocco, M. Structural control on the Tohoku earthquake rupture process investigated by 3D FEM, tsunami and geodetic data Scientific Reports, Nature Publishing Group, 2014, 4

Hence there is no Okada_vertical_component.R script here. Instead the co-seismic-deformation unit-sources (provided by Fabrizio Romano) were summed.
