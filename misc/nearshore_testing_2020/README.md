This folder contains code and links to data required for a study comparing models and observations of nearshore tsunamis in Australia. The working title of the paper is *Davies, G. et al. (2020) Global dissipation models for simulating tsunamis at far-field coasts up to 60 hours post-earthquake: Multi-site tests in Australia.*

From this repository you can access code, and there are instructions to download datasets (model input / model output / test data).

Note we rely on a separate install of the [SWALS source code](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/ptha/tree/master/propagation/SWALS), and the [rptha](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/ptha/tree/master/R) R package. Those links are inside this repository and can be followed for install instructions.
