This folder contains code and links to data required for a study comparing models and observations of nearshore tsunamis in Australia. The working title of the paper is *Davies, G. et al. (2020) Global dissipation models for simulating tsunamis at far-field coasts up to 60 hours post-earthquake: Multi-site tests in Australia.*

The sub-folders contain code as well as there are instructions to download zipped-versions of the folders with datasets (model input / model output / test data), which are too large to version control. In principle you could use this to re-run the study. Beware our job-submission and module-loading scripts are specific to the computer we were using, and some of our R scripts included hard-coded links to our SWALS install on that machine - these kinds of things would have to be updated.

Note we rely on a separate install of the [SWALS source code](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/ptha/tree/master/propagation/SWALS), and the [rptha](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/ptha/tree/master/R) R package. Those links are also in the [ptha repository](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/ptha).
