Make gauge-specific plots of model-vs-data time-series.

To make a few plots for the paper do:

    Rscript gauge_plots_sites.R

To make plots for all models/sites, do:

    Rscript gauges_plots_sites_all.R

The latter script makes a folder with many plots, and a zipped version can be [downloaded here](http://dapds00.nci.org.au/thredds/fileServer/fj6/PTHA/Nearshore_testing_2020/all_models_sites_vs_data.zip).
