# Gauge time-series locations

For this model we want to include gauges at:
* DART locations
* NZ DARTS
* Tide gauges (MHL / BOM / other)
  * Consider jittering the locations to work around situations where the model cell containing the point is land. 
* PTHA18 points near eastern Australia
* Other?
