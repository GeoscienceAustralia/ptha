# Files for NSW broadscale model

These files were used for some NSW wide modelling in 2023-2024.

Many were derived by modifying files in [../SW_WA_2021_2024/greater_perth_revised2023/](../SW_WA_2021_2024/greater_perth_revised2023/). For this project we use a different scenario sampling method (importance sampling, rather than stratified importance sampling) and so many of the scenario creation and probabilistic calculation scripts have changed.
