Most of the contents here are provided by Fabrizio Romano (see README_FABRIZIO_EMAIL.txt for details).

Exceptions are:
* convert_for_TFD.R was written by GD to make the source, using Fabrizio's program and inputs.
* FD_input_TRI.inp was copied and slightly modified from TFD_src_v5.0 for the case at hand.
