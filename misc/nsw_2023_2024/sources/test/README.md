This folder contains artificial scenarios that are useful in model testing:
* `extreme_source_kt43731_times_5` is very big, and will stress test the model for extreme inundation.
* `small_source_solomon2007_divided_by_1000` is very small. It can be easier to notice nesting artefacts with such small scenarios.
