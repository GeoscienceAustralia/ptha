# Code (but not data!) for the paper [Australian atmospheric pressure and sea level data during the 2022 Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai volcano tsunami](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-02949-2).

**The full dataset and code as used for the paper** can be [downloaded here](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8219621).

This folder only includes the code for post-processing sea level and pressure data, **but not the data itself**. 
* The code is written as though the data exists in a folder `original` in the current directory.
  * This means that links inside this repository will appear broken
* The solution is to [download the data+code package at this link](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8219621)
