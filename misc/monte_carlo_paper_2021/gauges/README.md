This folder contains both tsunami observations, and the site locations at which our hydrodynamic model stores time-series.

The sub-folders are:
* [nukualofa](./nukualofa) - Tide gauge data and associated code to parse it, used for model testing.
* [point_gauges](./point_gauges) - Locations where model time-series are stored.
