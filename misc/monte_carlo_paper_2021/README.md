Code for a paper with working title: "From offshore to onshore PTHA: Efficient Monte-Carlo sampling"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The directories contain:

* [./gauges](./gauges) -- Tide-gauge data used for model testing.

* [./optimal_sampling](./optimal_sampling) -- A script that implements the offshore analysis of various Monte-Carlo schemes. It creates Figures 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 from the paper (and many others) and reports on various statistics.

* [./sources](./sources) -- Code to select the particular set of random scenarios that was used for the onshore PTHA, and information on the source-models used for comparison with historic events.

* [./swals](./swals) -- The tsunami model application code.
