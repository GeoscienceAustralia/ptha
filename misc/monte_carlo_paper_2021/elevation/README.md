This folder is intended to contain elevation data that is used for the hydrodynamic modelling. However note the elevation rasters are not provided.

The contents of this folder are identical to [the contents of this directory, from an earlier iteration of the study](../../probabilistic_inundation_tonga2020/elevation). To reduce the size of this repository, we ask that you refer to that directory to see the folder structure.
