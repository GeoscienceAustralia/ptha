The code here can make panels of Figure 1 in the paper. The panels were manually combined to make Figure 1.

* [spatial_panel_plot.R](spatial_panel_plot.R) - Creates panels A and B of Figure 1. Note the current script included hard-coded links to the global-scale elevation dataset (and an associated zero-contour) that are not included here - to run it you would have to update with links to such data, and then do `Rscript spatial_panel_plot.R`. 

* [rate_curve_plot_all.R](rate_curve_plot_all.R) - Creates panels C, D, E, F of Figure 1. It can be run with `Rscript rate_curve_plot_all.R`.
