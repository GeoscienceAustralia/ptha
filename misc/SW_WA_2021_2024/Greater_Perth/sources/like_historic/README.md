This folder contains approximate source models for various earthquake-tsunamis on the Sunda Arc.

The models:
    FujiSatake2007	LoritoEtAl2010	PiatanesiLorito2007
are from this paper: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2020.598235/full

The model "sumatra2005" was derived using the finite-fault inversion in this
paper (https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggaa384) considering only the vertical
co-seismic displacement. A Kajiura filter was applied to the result using [apply_kajiura_to_rasters.R](apply_kajiura_to_rasters.R).

The model Fujii2021 is for the Sumatra 2004 tsunami, and was derived from the joint inversion in this paper: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00024-021-02909-6
