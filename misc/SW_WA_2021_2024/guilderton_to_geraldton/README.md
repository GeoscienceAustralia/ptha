# Tsunami modelling for the Guilderton to Geraldton area in 2023-2024

## Part of the WA Tsunami Inundation Modelling Project with DFES

This folder contains code used to model the region from Guilderton (which just north of Perth) to Geraldton. The codes are derived from the [2023 version of the Greater Perth Modelling files](../greater_perth_revised2023/) with some modifications to the folder structure and the model setup. 

The domain structure, elevation data, breakwalls, and initial-stage regions have been updated and improved in the Guilderton to Geraldton area. We also included several large buildings in the elevation data at Geraldton, to check the sensitivity of the results to the associated flow obstructions - the effect turned out to be minor for the products of interest.  

In this folder:
- An outline of how to setup the model is provided in [GENERAL_GUIDANCE_ON_MODEL_SETUP.md](GENERAL_GUIDANCE_ON_MODEL_SETUP.md).
- A summary of software that might help is in [USEFUL_TOOLS.md](USEFUL_TOOLS.md).
- An overview of the workflow with comments on the results is in [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md).

In brief, running the model first requires setting up the elevation data, optionally breakwalls, inverts, gauges and multi-domain design (mesh). Then the model can be run with the tsunami source models, which are generated by randomly sampling scenarios from the 2018 Australian PTHA. The shallow-water like solver SWALS is used to solve the hydrodynamic equations, and the results are post-processed to produce inundation maps and hazard products in the analysis folder.
Key folders are:

* [./analysis](./analysis) - Computations that use multiple simulated scenarios to produce outputs. Such as hazard products, and inundation maps that correspond to JATWC categories.
* [./breakwalls](./breakwalls) - Create 3d lines that are burned into the elevation model, to enforce breakwalls and other local high-points irrespective of model resolution.
* [./elevation](./elevation) - Elevation data + preference order for the SWALS model
* [./inverts](./inverts) - Create 3d lines that are burned into the elevation model, to enforce channels and other local low-points irrespective of model resolution.
* [./gauges](./gauges) - Locations of point-gauge output used in the SWALS model
* [./multidomain_design](./multidomain_design) - Create the boxes defining domains in the multidomain
* [./sources](./sources) - Tsunami source models
* [./swals](./swals) - Hydrodynamic model
* [.swals/outputs](./swals/outputs) - Output from the hydrodynamic model (not on github)
