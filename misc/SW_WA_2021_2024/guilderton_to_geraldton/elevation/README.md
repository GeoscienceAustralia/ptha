# Information to set the model elevation

* [make_swals_elevation_files_preference_list.R](make_swals_elevation_files_preference_list.R) is used to create a list of files (in preference order) that SWALS uses to fix the elevation.

On NCI the data sets are also linked into the data directory, using `ln -s source_data data/destination', to ease navigating to each dataset.
