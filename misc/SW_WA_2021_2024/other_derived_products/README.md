Small codes that were useful for collating outputs, plotting, etc.

* `WA_tsunami_modelling_2021_2024_definitive_outputs` - Copy key spatial outputs from NCI into a folder. This is involved enough that it was easier and safer to automate.
* `combine_raster_outputs` - Make a raster that combines the inundation-rate (84 percentile) of multiple models, using the "priority model" in its relevant region, and in some cases using the maximum of multiple models.
* `random_figures` - Various plotting codes that could be useful to reuse in future projects.
