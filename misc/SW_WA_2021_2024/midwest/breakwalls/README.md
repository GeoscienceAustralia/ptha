This directory contains a script to create x/y/z data representing the tops of breakwalls.

## Generate the breakwall data
First, generate breakwall data as you please and save it as a csv file in any subdirectory here. The csv file should have the following columns:
- `x` - x coordinate of the breakwall
- `y` - y coordinate of the breakwall
- `z` - z coordinate of the breakwall
For example, [buffer_height/make_breakwalls.R] is a script that generates breakwall data by taking a the maximum elevation around a line with a buffer around it. The breakwall data is saved as a csv file in the subdirectory `buffer_height`. The csv file is then used in the model. 

## Generate a list of breakwall files
Then, generate a list of breakwall files to be used in the model. This is done by running the R script [make_breakwalls_list.R](make_breakwalls_list.R). This script reads the breakwall data and writes a list of breakwall files to be used in the model. It reads any csv file in any subdirectory recursively and write a list of these files `swals_breakwalls_list.txt`.

__NOTE__: In this model we create a breakwall to close the Bunbury floodgate, but deliberately exclude it from the default list of breakwall files (generated by [make_breakwalls_list.R](make_breakwalls_list.R)). Another model separately enforced it depending on a parameter in the code.
