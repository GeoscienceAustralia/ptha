This folder contains:

* `highres_with_variance` - rasters describing the logic-tree mean inundation exceedance-rate (defined here as the mean number of events/year with which inundation depths exceed 1 mm). We also provide information on the Monte Carlo variance, which can be used to make a confidence interval for the `all scenarios` logic-tree mean inundation exceedance-rate.

* `highres_epistemic_uncertainty` - rasters describing epistemic uncertainties for inundation exceedance-rates (defined here as the mean number of events/year with which inundation depths exceed 1 mm).

* `max_stage_exceedance_rates` - rasters describing the logic-tree-mean exceedance-rate for various max-stage thresholds. This is useful for broadscale comparison with the offshore PTHA, or quickly looking at the max-stage associated with a given exceedance-rate, among other things.
