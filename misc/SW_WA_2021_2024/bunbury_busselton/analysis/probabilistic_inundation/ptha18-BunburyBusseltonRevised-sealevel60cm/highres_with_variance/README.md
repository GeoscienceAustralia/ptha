# Rate of inundation (depth > 1mm) for the logic-tree mean model

The folder [ptha18-BunburyBusseltonRevised-sealevel60cm-sum_of_source_zones](ptha18-BunburyBusseltonRevised-sealevel60cm-sum_of_source_zones) contains rasters with the exceedance-rate (events/year) of inundation (depth > 1mm), according to the logic-tree-mean model, with a conservative background sea-level of 0.6 m AHD. To see how it was created, see documentation in [../../README.md](../../README.md).
