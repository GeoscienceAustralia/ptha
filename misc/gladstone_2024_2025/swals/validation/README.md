# Validation tests

There are three historical scenarios to run for:
    - Tohoku 2011 (published by Yamazaki et al., 2018), 
    - Chile 2010 (Fuji and Satake 2013; and Lorito 2011) and
    - Solomon 2007 (published by Wei et al., 2015; and a scaled PTHA18 unit source).
Then plot the model's gauges against historic gauges with `compute_gauges_*.R` then `plot_gauges_*.R`.
Additionally, the 'H95' statisitic can be exctracted using `compute_H95.R`, which may be compared to comparable statistics from JATWC.
