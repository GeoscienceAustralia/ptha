#  Full duration tests

This directory contains pbs jobs to run full duration tests of the SWALS model. These use more compute than the initial tests in [../test](../test) so ensure the initial tests are running well before running these full tests. These include a run with the tidal adjustment (tides varying), an extreme source, small source, and some low resolution versions for convergence checks.
