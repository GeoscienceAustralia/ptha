# SWALS test cases
All model runs here cover a short time, and are only used for preliminary debugging of the model setup, and to provide model runs from which load balance files can be created.

- [model_debug](model_debug.pbs) -- see if it runs
- [model_load_balance](model_load_balanced.pbs) -- see if it runs with load balancing
- [model_load_balance_static](model_load_balanced_static.pbs) -- run it with load balancing using a static tide
