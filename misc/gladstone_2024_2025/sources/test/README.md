This folder contains artificial scenarios that are useful in model testing:
* [extreme_source_kt43731_times_5/](extreme_source_kt43731_times_5/) is very big, and will stress test the model for extreme inundation.
* [small_source_solonon2007_divided_by_1000/](small_source_solonon2007_divided_by_1000/) is a very small scenario which may pick up nesting problems in the multidomain design.
