Compare the results using a spatially varying HAT to the static runs with corresponding HAT sea levels.

## Spot Check
Compare the maximum stages at points. 
Plot modelled depths (or stage) against each other for each location.

## Exrate Comparison
Plot the logic tree mean inundation and speed exceeding 1.543 m/s (3 knots) results.
