The Manning friction coefficient can be set from a raster file. The default friction is set in the file [../swals/model_multidomain_design_mod.f90](../swals/model_multidomain_design_mod.f90). This will be overridden by the value in the files manually listed in [swals_manning_n_files_in_preference_order.txt](../friction/swals_manning_n_files_in_preference_order.txt). These tif files should be in the same coordinate system as the model (EPGS:4326).
