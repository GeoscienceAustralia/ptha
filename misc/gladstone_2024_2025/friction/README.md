By default, friction is set in the file [../swals/model_multidomain_design_mod.f90](../swals/model_multidomain_design_mod.f90). However, this can be overridden by a series of raster files manually listed in [swals_manning_n_files_in_preference_order.txt](../friction/swals_manning_n_files_in_preference_order.txt). These tif files should be in the same coordinate system as the model (EPGS:4326). Areas where these friction rasters are not covered assume the default value.
