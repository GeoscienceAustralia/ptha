# Sea level rise scenario

Figures to plot the affect of sea level rise on a single scenario. We ran a scenario at 0.0 m HAT and at +0.8 m HAT. Ensure they have rasters for max speed and stage (or more as desired) and adjust the scripts mentioned here glob there. First run `compute_raster_diff.R` to compute the difference between the rasters. Then plot the difference with sea level rise using `plot_slr.R`.
