* [./probabilistic_inundation_tonga2020](./probabilistic_inundation_tonga2020) - A probabilistic inundation hazard analysis for Tongatapu. I suggest to use an improved variant of this analysis which is available in [./monte_carlo_paper_2021](./monte_carlo_paper_2021)

* [./monte_carlo_paper_2021](./monte_carlo_paper_2021) - Code and links to data for our [paper on Monte-Carlo techniques for PTHA](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggac140). While the Monte-Carlo techniques used in this study are general, they are illustrated via a probabilistic inundation hazard analysis for Tongatapu.
