This folder contains:

* [SW_WA_2021_2024](SW_WA_2021_2024) - Code for some models in south-west Western Australia. Parts of this were used in [this ICCE 2022 conference paper](https://doi.org/10.9753/icce.v37.papers.18).

* [./hunga_tonga_data_paper](./hunga_tonga_data_paper) - Code for a paper presenting [observations of the Hunga-Tonga tsunami and pressure wave in Australia](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-02949-2).

* [./monte_carlo_paper_2021](./monte_carlo_paper_2021) - Code and links to data for our [paper on Monte-Carlo techniques for PTHA](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggac140). While the Monte-Carlo techniques used in this study are general, they are illustrated via a probabilistic inundation hazard analysis for Tongatapu. 

* [./nearshore_testing_2020](./nearshore_testing_2020) - Code and links to data for [our paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2020.598235/full) which simulated tsunamis using various finite-fault inversions, and compares with nearshore tsunami data in Australia.

* [./nsw_2023_2024](./nsw_2023_2024) - Code for the NSW broadscale model.

* [./probabilistic_inundation_tonga2020](./probabilistic_inundation_tonga2020) - A probabilistic inundation hazard analysis for Tongatapu. I suggest to use an improved variant of this analysis which is available in [./monte_carlo_paper_2021](./monte_carlo_paper_2021)
